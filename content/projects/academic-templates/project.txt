Title: Academic templates

Text: 

If you need a simple template for academic purpose, this very page can be useful.

Here you can find two easy-to-use and slightly customizable templates. They're free and I will try to keep them updated. 
All you need to start is inside the html file.

### Customization
You need at least a basic html knowledge to update the page. If you know also CSS, you can easily change colors, font and so on.


```css
/* -----  Customize  -------------------------------------------------------- */

body {
  color: #222; /* text color */
  background: #fff; /* outer background */
  /* font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace; /* Monospace font */
  font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif; /* Sans Serif font */
  /* font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; /* Serif font */
}

hr {
  background: #333; /* divider color */
}

li:before {
  content: "â€¢"; /* list bullet type */
}

.main {
  background: #fff; /* inner background */
  max-width: 660px; /* text width */
}
```

When you're happy with your font choice (between a serif, a sans serif and a Monospace alternatives), you can edit this line in order to gain some speed:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inconsolata:400,700|Source+Serif+Pro:400,700|Nunito+Sans:400,700" rel="stylesheet">
```

The `font-family` you specify in the `body` and the one you keep inside the above link must match.

For exemple, if you choose `Nunito Sans`, the previous line becomes:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans:400,700" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Currently in use
Francesco Lin (lol)
Let me know if you use AT! (:

### Requirements
There's no dependency. This kind of template don't work well with very old browsers.

### Support
Sorry, but I am not available for personal support. You can try to drop me a line, but probably I won't be able to reply after a short time.

### Licence
If you use or build upon this code, please provide a link to my site.
