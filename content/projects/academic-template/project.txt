Text: 

If you need a simple page for academic purpose, this very page can be useful.
Academic is the name of a set of easy-to-use and slightly customizable templates. They're free and I will try to keep them updated. No support.

**Knowledge**
You need at least a basic html5 knowledge (to update the page). If you know also CSS, you can easily change colors, font and so on.

**Requirements**
Nothing. It's all inside the page. There's no dependency  I've used some "modern" layouts model, like Flexbox.
Probably this king of layout don't work well with IE before 9.

**Support**
Sorry, but I am not available for personal support. If you've problem, you can try to drop me a line. I'll do my  best to answer.

**Licence**
